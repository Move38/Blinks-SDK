// This file defaines the fuses for the bootloader 
// Normally the fuses will only change when the bootloader is programmed.
// Programming a game should not require changing the fuses. 

// The only fuse that must be changed from the factory default is the BOOTRST
// This fuse makes it so that we always start the bootloader after a reset
